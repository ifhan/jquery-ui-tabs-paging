Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-tabs-paging

When tabs do not fit within the width of the containing UL, "previous" and "next" buttons are displayed to scroll through tabs.
Features :
* Automatically resizes when window size changes.
* Next and Previous buttons are configurable.
* Paging automatically re-initialized when tabs are added or removed (deprecated in jQuery UI 1.9)
* "Next" button is automatically set at a fixed distance from the right of the UL.
* Tested with jQuery UI themes
